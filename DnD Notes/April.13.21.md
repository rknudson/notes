## What Percentage of a Mad Max Train Cannon Could A Wyvern fill with Piss?
- According to This article on the [D&D SRD](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Wyvern#:~:text=WYVERN%20%20%20Size%2FType%20%3A%20%20%20Large,touch%20%20...%20%2017%20more%20rows%20) a wyvern weighs about one ton, or 2000 pounds. 
- According to [this](https://horseyhooves.com/how-much-does-a-horse-weigh/#:~:text=Horse%20Weight%20and%20Height%20Chart%20%20%20,142%20-%20150%20%2027%20more%20rows%20) the average horse weighs about 500 kg. 
	- I misread the initial measurement as 500 lbs
- I assume a D&D Mad Max train cannon is a [WW2 German Howitzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_cm_sFH_18). The diameter of this is 149 mm and length is 7.849 m, which gives the barrel a volume of 136.855 liters
- According to [this](https://horseracingsense.com/why-do-race-horses-have-to-pee-bad/#:~:text=Horses%20typically%20pee%202.5%20gallons%20of%20urine%20a,to%20about%20two%20and%20a%20half%20gallons%20daily.) a racehorce pisses 2.5 gallons
- If a wyvern is 2000 lbs and a horse is 1100, a wyvern is 181% the size of a wyvern, and could piss 4.5 gallons in one go, which is about 17.27 liters. Or 12.69%
